Perhaps a list with very short descriptions of the concepts contained in classical electromagnetism belongs in this article, that then redirect the reader to other pages to learn more. The term \"\"classical electromagnetism\"\" is a high level term that embodies a huge field of phenomena. As a result, I believe this article should have a high-level, descriptive tone (no equations) and then link to other pages heavily.   \"\n",

One of the hallmarks of the classic conspiracy theory is that the proponents of it deeply believe in it. So, in calling any such claims by members of the BA a \"\"conspiracy theory\"\", those so naming it are inherently stating that those BA members really believed their claims. Which would seem to me to be directly in contradiction with another classic claim of those who oppose Bush, to wit, that BA people knew the whole thing was bogus, and deliberately lied/misled people about it, in order to drum up support for the invasion.

            " :::It's not that definitions are bullshit, or that nothing is definable. A more correct statement would be that all definitions are examples of deconstruction. The root meaning define is the idea that you are finishing something, or bringing it to a finite end. But the minute you \"\"kill\"\" a word by defining it is also the minute you give birth to a new definition. So, the difficulty with defining any word is that a definition is both \"\"the final word\"\", and \"\"the origination\"\" of what is to be defined. Thus, it's not that \"\"nothing is definable\"\", but rather, a definition is kind of like Schroedinger's cat: it's in a state of both life and death. And the word deconstruction is especially difficult to define, because the definition has to reflect the meaning of deconstruction on two levels: (1) it has to say what deconstruction is (or is not), and (2) the definition has to illustrate the definition of deconstruction by example. Any definition of deconstruction that claims to be The Final Word is demonstrably false.  \"\n",

The states that have no organic connection with Iran , like Abkhazia , Georgia , Chechenia and Daghistan can't be easily considered as Khanates , as their rulers where not khans , and their title was Wālī ,Shamkhal and etc (and perhaps Armenian Malikdoms ).Anyway , I prefer this sentence: Baku Khanate was a autonomous Muslim principality on the territory of modern day Azerbaijan under Iranian suzerainty.

But we have ice core samples and other data that extnd back hundreds of thousands of years, and by all evidence, the CO² levels today are as high as they were during the Jurrassic period. This carbon dioxide level has been increasing at a still not yet fully understood level due to fossil fuel use. IT may be anywhere from 1 to 30 percent. No doubt, humans are not the only reason the earth has been warming now for over 150 years, however, there are few if any scientists that can argue with the observable data, whereby, there was only bigotry to base dysgenics on.

However, I was also very clear with the creator on his talk page that the idea of a division of HP having its own article was unusual and that other editors would probably try to delete it on that basis.  I believe that's a very legitimate reason to try to delete that page and I note that a prod tag has recently been added to the page, with which I don't really disagree.  I would hope that some of the information gets added to the Hewlett Packard article, because I wouldn't like to see useful information lost from the 'pedia entirely, but I won't be making any heroic efforts to defend the page further.  I don't think I will take any further hand in this unless there is something you'd like me to do that will assist you  if that is the case, I'd be happy to help if you leave me a note telling me what you'd like.

He was selected for the example because he was the guy on the TV when the students came in my office to make their case.  Our University excludes Wikipedia exclusively due to it's abject inaccuracy on practically every subject where \"\"general consensus\"\" holds a particular bias.  My initial examples were the subjects of: race, religion, political affiliation, perceived bias, climate change and economic recovery.  We randomly selected four of the categories and designed the experiment to provide an accurate result.  In every category, each of us attempted to insert ACTION (defined as the actual events) into the wiki page corresponding to the category, from a referenced source, but from a source with perceived bias against the general consensus bias.  All of the links and verbiage were approved by the dept. and student advisory board, and, determined to be entirely accurate.  Those were the rules...  Had any two been successful, they would have gotten a \"\"B\"\" on their project.  All four failed.

But when he gets to Q18, he has a couple of reasons to pick 'English' and/or 'Australian' in preference to 'Aboriginal'. One is that he's already acknowledged the Aboriginal side of the family.

I sincerely doubt this one, in particular, can ever go anywhere since policy change requires consensus and, as you've noticed, people have very different conceptions about what categories are for.  Perhaps an approach would be for a small group of folks to go off and work on a proposal not to be put up for general comment until it's in nearly final form.  I think WP:SFD was done this way.

This definition of Dialect agrees neither with the Websters nor the common definition. The Websters is known. As for the common understanding of the word, to tell an inhabitant of Oxford or Paris that he's speaking a dialect could well be considered an insult.

In other words, it's highly doubtful that anyone actually believed smallpox could be transferred by way of an inanimate object e.g blankets, tomahawk, piece of meat, a twig,etc. I don't know where this story came from about white people trying to infect Indians with smallpox by blankets, but I've seen quite a few attempts to plant that nonsense into narratives about white and Indian conflicts.

I suggest that images that receive this status should be highly encyclopedic images, although not necessarily of excellent quality. Images that illustrate a point in an exemplary manner, for example, could be nominated as these 'Encyclopedic Images'. There would obviously be problems, for example: who defines an image as being encyclopedic or the most valuable of a large group of images? What scope should or could an image be nominated within? Thus, a vote of consensus would be required. I think the initiation of such an area would benefit Wikipedia. Diagrams, sounds and various other media could also be included in this.

He had played on Edmonton Oilers for years beaming quite the legend. He later then moved to Boston Bruins in his Career. He also had appeared for the St. Louis Blues, that's right he is the walking legend himself Wayne Gretzky. He then realized his true sport, American football. He had been able to find a clone ability and every black footballer known to man kind is Sir Nathan himself. His baseball career involved negatives at the beginning,  then later he got his legend status. That is right he is Jackie Robbinson, he suffered abuse from racist fans in his early  days. He took the abuse and he ended up being the first ever black baseball player too, truly a legend. After retiring from all those sports he found his true profession in life, Professional football.  He went up through Inter Milan youth system,  him and balotelli fucked shit up. They got 210 goals combined in his first debut season. Him and Balotelli decided to go on and make them own team. It was Balotelli FC where people of white consent were not allowed to play. He went bar down 200 times with Balotelli FC. There team truly went on to be victorious winning 21 trophies in there first season. Their team is  among 7 different leagues, they brought Italy to greatness winning the world cup 2 times, still to this day Balotelli and Nathan fuck shit up. They have scored 29 goals in the past 4 minutes. Being one of the best footballers was too boring for the great nate,  he wanted bigger and better.

Wikipedia is tertiary literature, meaning it summarises the reviews and textbooks which themselves summarise or evaluate primary research (although some primary sources are acceptable). So the way to make edits that stick is to always put a citation to a reliable source.

Though most know that those videos show the killings done by LTTE them selves. Even their picture of Black july ( in the Wikipedia page of Black July) shows Tamils only. the bullies around the naked man are nothing but tamils, and every one knows that. and  are done by LTTE them selves.

And, it's NOT always an easy road to be on.  MANY people just give up and shut up and be quiet to avoid getting yelled at.  But, then we LOSE those people's creative new ideas that they might have had if they hadn't been to afraid to speak UP!!!

I'd comment on the likely probability of it, cite the sources where it came from, and discuss how it was meant to be fulfilled. It really is irrelevant what we feel about an article, as long as we report factually accurate information that is not misleading, yes? It is a fact that, based upon Thirkettle's comment, ESA intends to use Kliper for circumlunar missions. That's it, period. We know nothing about launchers they plan to use or not use, what funds they are allocating, or even how likely it is. The simple provenance of the source is good enough for me, which is not to say that is guaranteed to be true, as things change. Wondering how they'll fund it, what they'll launch it with or what missions they'll do is indeed pointless without evidence. We have an ESA top-man saying that Kliper will be used for independent circumlunar access. We have more information about this than we even have about the Onega rocket, and that's supposed to be the launcher for goodness sake - nobody disputes that because it's boring, but reliably reported. As unlikely as it might be, if the same director said 'we plan to launch Kliper with a Saturn 5', I'd laugh my ass off, but still report that he said it nonetheless.\n",

Since adopting the incredibly inactive wiki about a month ago we have greatly increased the article count and modernized it from it's previous state. The problem is there are not many active members on the site and we need more for the site to properly grow. It is well organized and on it's way to be a great site we just need more editors to expand. It is based on Wikia's network of wikis. Like Wikipedia it is free to use and the editing process is exactly the same. If you know how to edit Wikipedia you will know how to edit the Liverpool F.C. wiki. Now for the question you may be asking yourself. Why edit there? Wikipedia has articles on Liverpool. This is true. At the Liverpool wiki it is all about Liverpool. We allow editors to edit anything about Liverpool no matter how trivial. We allow edits on reserve and academy players, and even things as trivial as the fitness coaches for the year 2011. We also do not lock pages to registered users. That means if you have something to say about Steven Gerrard you can click edit and not view source and actually write something.

Maybe because you're so busy as a new Wikipedia:Admin?\"\" This sounds very similar to flamings by  who, some weeks ago, frequently deleted all references relating to Adams's homosexuality. See also his reply to administrator  on  \"\"Yet again I have to request that you read facts and know what you are talking about before commenting. I suggest, since this matter is in the hands of Wikipedia:Mediator Ed Poor, that it might be best for you to refrain from further comments and not interfere in the process.\"\" See, in addition, this user's attempts at silencing me by repeatedly accusing me of vandalism and deleting my contributions to the Talk:Nick Adams page and some related pages. Why are users Wyss and Ted Wilkes so keenly interested to suppress every reference that Nick Adams was gay? See also Natalie Wood and Talk:Natalie Wood where information concerning Wood's contacts to Hollywood gays taken from a current biography has been repeatedly deleted by user Wyss. On the Talk:Nick Adams page, this user now claims that he \"\"found zero documented evidence to even thinly support any assertion under WP standards that Mr Adams was a homosexual\"\" and that none of my edits \"\"are supported by documented evidence cited in peer-reviewed, secondary sources\"\". In my opinion, this seems to be a new strategy by user Ted Wilkes (using an alias) to suppress any reference that Adams was gay. I am quite sure that users Ted Wilkes and Wyss must be identical, as  is all too familiar with David Bret's writings (see also Talk:David Bret) and uses similar arguments as Ted Wilkes presents to suppress my contributions to the articles on Nick Adams and Natalie Wood.

He wants to depict certain wars as war crimes themselves not based upon actual outrageous events that are well defined war crimes, but on ambiguous legal opinions tied to the intentions or rationales used by the belligerents involved in starting them. This is POV forking because it tries to establish a point of view not at all justifiable within the articles concerning war crimes nor the wars themselves' legalities sections. Thus he has a page which- declares the war he dislikes,  a war crime, and simultaneously casts aspersion on the legality of that war, free from having to argue with the editors of the articles that have those topics within them.
